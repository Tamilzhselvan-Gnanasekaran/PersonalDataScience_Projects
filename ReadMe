Hi, Welcome to personal repository of Data Science projects.

I practice data science by using publicly available datasets to explore, find insights/patterns/problems and add values or provide solutions to the problem statements.
These concepts/experiments are practiced in the aim of improving the business process, influencing the stragetic decisions with data and story telling.

I'm a daily learner and Do let me know if you have any interesting data science problems to solve.
Will learn and practice together!
Cheers!
